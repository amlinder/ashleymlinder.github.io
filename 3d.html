    <p> The Theme I've chosen for this semesters projects is Connection. We all strive to make connections of varying degrees of importance in our lives.
      Especially in times like these where we are forced to be apart for nearly everything we need to do our best to keep people connected. I want to help foster
      those connections in my practice. This is the first step in that process
      The locket I've modeled for Project 1 is a physical symbol of that connection. In my eyes, lockets have always been a way to keep an image of someone nearby and on your person.
      It keeps them in your thoughts and inspires you to keep the connection between you guys alive. I plan to contimue building and expanding on this theme of connection
      over the course of the semester. Hope to hear from you guys soon about your own projects! </p>

      <h2> Best Wishes, </h2>
