      <p>Keeper is a visual novel game about connection and relationships. In the world we currently live in, we are very separate and kept apart by uncontrolled forces.
       Keeper creates those links we may be missing by immersing the player into a fantasy world of intrigue and mystery. The three patrons you will meet in as the Barkeep
       of the Dancing Dragon Inn will come to you for companionship as well as alcohol. What you choose will affect the ending of each character's story. What will you choose? </p>
