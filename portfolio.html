      <h3><i> Transmissions</i>, Video, 2018</h3>
      <p>My life is romanticized by the music in my ears as I walk the city streets. Everything hits a beat and these are the music transmissions that infiltrate my sleep. </p>
      <p> This project is a collection of videos I took at home, on campus and across the city. The "transmission" is how my brain flips through memories and thoughts while I
        listen to music. I synchronized the clicking in the music to the change in images or blackness as if to flip back and forth between the transmissions. </p>

      <h3> <i> Memory</i>, Glitch Art, 2018 </h3>
      <p> There's something really unsettling about destroying images that mean a lot to us. This picture is full of so many emotions that I wanted to pick it apart to its bare
        essentials, take away the color, or specific colors. Just break it down into something unlike it was before. For this project used the audacity program to afflict the
        picture and make it glicth. </p>

      <h3> <i> Cosmo Covers </i>, Phototshop, 2018 </h3>
      <p> For this project I took my best freind Mikayla's pictures of her makeup looks and turn them into this jab at the beauty industry as well as the conventional
        standards of beauty. The diffrent headlines are exxagerated versions of the real article headlines that Cosmo often publishes. I used Photoshop adding layers of text with
        drop shadow and added a black and white layer to pull the color out in her eye shadow. </p>

      <h3><i>Free the Bees</i>, Phototshop Composite, 2019</h3>
      <p> In this project I found and recolored a Bee and made a collage out of that bee in the shape of every contitinent. This symbolizes the need on
        that out would has for bees. Without them we would cease to exist in just a few days. They pollinate our food, they even pollineate the trees we need to breathe oxygen. They are essential
        to our survival and should not be ignored.This project used a single bee that I recolored, resized and duplicated in order to shape the contitinents. </p>

      <h3><i>Waters of Old</i>, Google Earth Composite, 2018</h3>
      <p> This peice is a collection of lakes and rivers across the US in diffrent areas. I was fascinated by the differnces in the color of the water
        per the area I pulled them from and I put them on a neutral blue background to enhance the diffrences in color.

      <h3><i>Everything Changes, And I'll Be Ok</i> , Video, 2018</h3>
      <p>This work speaks to my feelings since moving from my hometown in Kingsburg, CA to the giant city of San Jose, CA for college. It's been a bit of a struggle but I have a strong support
        system and I know that I'll be ok. Eventually.</p>
      <p> This video is a collection of old videos I've taken in my hometown as well as some I've taken here. The smaller frame represents the old vdeos as farther away memories and the new footage of my new home
        here in San Jose is big and present in the frame. </p>

      <h3> <i> Big Bubble Array</i>, Javascript Processing, 2019 </h3>
      <h3><a href="images/bubble.pde"> See Code </a> </h3>
      <p> This is my favorite peice I've made in Processing. The bouncing ellipse arrays make this repeating beautiful rainbow pattern of a diamond as they bounce
        behind the bigger bubbles on the outside of the frame. </p>

      <h3> <i>Sounds of Home </i>, Sound Art, 2018</h3>
      <p> This peice is about my home back in Kingsburg, CA. It's my idealized comfort place. I layered the sounds of: thunder and lightning to remember the times spent in the rain,
        my senior recital in highschool playing Clair De Lune on flute, my dog as a puppy barking, and the sound of my playstation turning on and myself playing Spider-Man. This was
        all layered and edited using the Audacity sound tools. </p>

      <h3> <i> Level Design 101</i>, Unity Engine, 2018 </h3>
      <p> This project was a few screencaptures of my first dive into game design. Using the base Unity tutorials as well as my own level design I made a functional beginning Level
        to an astronaut platoformer game. All the assets were pre-made but the level and number of enemies were built by myself.</p>
