    <h3> <i> Escape the Night </i>, The Game Crafter, 2019 </h3>
    <p>A Player vs. Player board game.  You and another player have been kidnapped a placed into an arena against your will to fight for your lives. The arena is dark and thick with forest trees.
       There is a mechanical monster circling the area who has a taste for blood and you have a lot to spare.. However, there is a way to escape and a very specific way to do it. You must collect
       materials to light a fire as well as climb the cliffs surrounding the only clearing in the arena, and a helicopter will come to rescue you. Will you escape?

      <h3><i> Transmissions</i>, Video, 2018</h3>
      <p>My life is romanticized by the music in my ears as I walk the city streets. Everything hits a beat and these are the music transmissions that infiltrate my sleep. </p>
      <p> This project is a collection of videos I took at home, on campus and across the city. The "transmission" is how my brain flips through memories and thoughts while I
        listen to music. I synchronized the clicking in the music to the change in images or blackness as if to flip back and forth between the transmissions. </p>

      <h3> <i> Memory</i>, Glitch Art, 2018 </h3>
      <p> There's something really unsettling about destroying images that mean a lot to us. This picture is full of so many emotions that I wanted to pick it apart to its bare
        essentials, take away the color, or specific colors. Just break it down into something unlike it was before. For this project used the audacity program to afflict the
        picture and make it glicth. </p>

      <h3> <i> Cosmo Covers </i>, Phototshop, 2018 </h3>
      <p> For this project I took my best freind Mikayla's pictures of her makeup looks and turn them into this jab at the beauty industry as well as the conventional
        standards of beauty. The diffrent headlines are exxagerated versions of the real article headlines that Cosmo often publishes. I used Photoshop adding layers of text with
        drop shadow and added a black and white layer to pull the color out in her eye shadow. </p>

      <h3><i> Grand Bow of Idrasil</i>, Video and Fusion 360 Model, 2019</h3>
      <p> The Alita are a tribe of people who are revered for their ranger abilities and their connection to nature. They are a hunter society that worships the Wilds and the gods that inhabit them. At the center of their culture is a Goddess that
        they call the Huntress, or the Matron of the Wilds. The landscape was barren and bleak and terrorized by the Elder Beast, a beast of massive size and terror, until the Huntress brought the sapling of the Everheart. The Sapling bloomed and
        billowed into a tree of massive scale and brought life and natures abundance to the landscape as well as the people together. Then the Huntress took a branch from the Everheart and crafted the bow she named Idrasil to defeat the Elder Beast
        and bring peace to the landscape. After the battle the Huntress gifted the bow to the most wise and powerful among the people and gifted them Idrasil as a show of their status as leader. The bow is now only used in ceremonies for every new
        leader to prove their strength among the Wilds before taking power. </p>
        <p> This project was to create a 3D printed object that had some signifigance like an ancient artifact. It was modeled with Fusion 360 and and painted.</p>

      <h3><i>Free the Bees</i>, Phototshop Composite, 2019</h3>
      <p> In this project I found and recolored a Bee and made a collage out of that bee in the shape of every contitinent. This symbolizes the need on
        that out would has for bees. Without them we would cease to exist in just a few days. They pollinate our food, they even pollineate the trees we need to breathe oxygen. They are essential
        to our survival and should not be ignored.This project used a single bee that I recolored, resized and duplicated in order to shape the contitinents. </p>

      <h3><i>Magic</i>, Blender 3D Model, 2019</h3>
      <p> The ancients fortold of a famed spellsword that changed the fates of the continent. These were his wepaons of choice.</p>
      <p> My first high quality 3D render project. We made a still life image with appropriate area and reflective lighting, dynamic textures with bump
        maps, and well composed camera positions.</p>

      <h3><i>Everything Changes, And I'll Be Ok</i> , Video, 2018</h3>
      <p>This work speaks to my feelings since moving from my hometown in Kingsburg, CA to the giant city of San Jose, CA for college. It's been a bit of a struggle but I have a strong support
        system and I know that I'll be ok. Eventually.</p>
      <p> This video is a collection of old videos I've taken in my hometown as well as some I've taken here. The smaller frame represents the old vdeos as farther away memories and the new footage of my new home
        here in San Jose is big and present in the frame. </p>

      <h3> <i>Sounds of Home </i>, Sound Art, 2018</h3>
      <p> This peice is about my home back in Kingsburg, CA. It's my idealized comfort place. I layered the sounds of: thunder and lightning to remember the times spent in the rain,
        my senior recital in highschool playing Clair De Lune on flute, my dog as a puppy barking, and the sound of my playstation turning on and myself playing Spider-Man. This was
        all layered and edited using the Audacity sound tools. </p>
