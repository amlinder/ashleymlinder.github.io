      <h3><i>Everything Changes, And I'll Be Ok</i> , Video, 2018</h3>
      <p>This work speaks to my feelings since moving from my hometown in Kingsburg, CA to the giant city of San Jose, CA for college. It's been a bit of a struggle but I have a strong support
        system and I know that I'll be ok. Eventually. </p>

      <h3><i>Waters of Old</i>, Google Earth Composite, 2018</h3>
      <p> This peice is a collection of lakes and rivers across the US in diffrent areas. I was fascinated by the differnces in the color of the water
        per the area I pulled them from and I put them on a neutral blue background to enhance the diffrences in color.

        the inside of what it entails to make a game.</p>

      <p>This peice was an exploation of my subconsious to continue with my feelings about 'The Big Move'. I picked new and old videos to represent the diffrences between my life When
        I was in Middle and High School. A lot has changed but so have I.</p>

      <h3><i> Transmissions</i>, Video, 2018</h3>
      <p>My life is romanticized by the music in my ears as I walk the city streets. Everything hits a beat and these are the music transmissions that infiltrate my sleep. </p>

      <h3> <i> Memory</i>, Glitch Art, 2018 </h3>
      <p> There's something really unsettling about destroying images that mean a lot to us. This picture is full of so many emotions that I wanted to pick it apart to its bare
        essentials, take away the color, or specific colors. Just break it down into something unlike it was before. </p>

      <h3> <i> Big Bubble Array</i>, Javascript Processing, 2019 </h3>
      <p> This is my favorite peice I've made in Processing. The bouncing ellipse arrays make this repeating beautiful rainbow pattern of a diamond as they bounce 
      behind the bigger bubbles on the outside of the frame.  </p>
