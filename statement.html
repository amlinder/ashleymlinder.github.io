      <p>I am an interdisciplinary artist who mainly focuses in Digital Media. Using digital means, I create artworks that aim to make an emotional impact on the viewer. These artworks range from video art, sound art, and digital composites, and can
        either be projected into large-scale pieces as well as on personal screens. While the message behind each piece varies, my main aim is to create work that conveys a specific emotion that the viewer can easily relate to or that they
        themselves have also experienced that same or similar emotion. We can often feel alone in this world sometimes and I think itâ€™s important to realize that we aren't alone and there is always someone there who can empathize with what we're
        going through. I plan to continue this mission through my artwork past graduation as well as make strides into the game development industry. </p>
