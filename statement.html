        <p> I like to call myself an Artist in Progress. I learn somthing new in art everyday and I feel a great sense of imporatnce to continue
          on and become better for as long as I'm able. Art has always been a huge source of hope and expression for me in all its forms. I've found
          my niche with Digial Media Art and I am so eager to learn more and branch out into the depths of what it can offer. I usually work in Adobe
          prouducts like Photoshop and Premire, as well as use with beginning program languages like HTML and CSS. </p>
          <p> One of my favortie projects to work of was my Abmient video project. When I was gathering clips for that project, I was having a great time
            just grabbing clips and making video that creates that ambient style video with intersecting clips that are more fun and upbeat. It was all very
            innate and collected randomly to create the product on my portfolio page. I'm in progress and I'm
            excited to be in progress for as long as humanly posisble. </p>
