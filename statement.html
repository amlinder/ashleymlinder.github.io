      <p>I am an interdisciplinary artist who mainly focuses in Digital Media. Using digital means, I create atworks that aim to make an emotional impact on the veiwer.
        These artworks range from video art, sound art, and digital composites, and can either be projected into large-scale peices as well as on personal screens.
        While the message behind each peice varies, my main aim is to create work that conveys a specific emotion that the veiwer can easly relate to or that they
        themselves have also experienced that same or similar emotion. We can often feel alone in ths world somtimes and I think its important to realize that we aren't alone
        and there is always someone there who can empathize with what we're going through. </p>
