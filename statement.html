        <p> I like to call myself an Artist in Progress. I learn somthing new in art everyday and I feel a great sense of imporatnce to continue
          on and become better for as long as I'm able. Art has always been a huge source of hope and expression for me in all its forms. I've found
          my niche with Digial Media Art and I am so eager to learn more and branch out into the depths of what it can offer. I'm in progress and I'm
          excited to be in progress for as long as humanly posisble.</p>
